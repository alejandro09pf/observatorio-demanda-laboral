## üéØ What Is This System?

The **Labor Market Observatory for Latin America** is an **intelligent, automated system** designed to monitor and analyze technical skill demands across Latin American labor markets. Think of it as a "**skill radar**" that continuously scans job postings to understand what technical abilities employers are seeking.

### **Core Concept**

Imagine having a **real-time dashboard** that shows:
- Which programming languages are most in demand in Colombia?
- What cloud platforms are trending in Mexico?
- How skill requirements are evolving in Argentina?
- Which skills are emerging as "must-haves" across the region?

This system provides exactly that - **data-driven insights** into labor market dynamics that can inform career decisions, educational planning, and policy making.

### **What It Does**

1. **üï∑Ô∏è Web Scraping**: Automatically collects job postings from major Latin American job portals
2. **üß† Skill Extraction**: Uses AI to identify technical skills mentioned in job descriptions
3. **ü§ñ LLM Enhancement**: Leverages large language models to understand implicit skill requirements
4. **üìä Analysis**: Clusters and analyzes skills to identify patterns and trends
5. **üìà Reporting**: Generates comprehensive reports and visualizations
