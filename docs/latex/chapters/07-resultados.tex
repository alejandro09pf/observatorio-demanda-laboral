\chapter{RESULTS}

Must present the results of the quality control process, according to what was defined in the methodology. For instance, in a software development project, this section should include the results from standard software testing (unit, functional, system, acceptance, etc.). It is important for them to be consistent with the objective of the project and the methodology used for its development.

This chapter must include an analysis of the results obtained, and conclusions from this analysis.
