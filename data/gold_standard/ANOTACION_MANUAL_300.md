From Silver.devMotion is one of the most successful startups coming out from YC so far, making it an outstanding career opportunity for growth and equity compensation. The technical founder is committed and recruited the entire current team by himself. This is one of those few opportunities of a lifetime we can get remotely, and the opportunity matches the expectations of candidates.This is an S-Tier company with an S-Tier interview process.About MotionProject management systems today are great at letting companies record their tasks, but place all of the burden on human project coordinators. These tools dont know about the teams time and resources and dont have any intelligence someone has to manually match tasks against their assumptions about the teams capacity. Not only does this process waste precious company resources, its also error-prone and leads to overwork, missed deadlines, miscommunication, and micromanagement.Motion is building the worlds most intelligent project management system one that doesnt require a project coordinator manually tracking each task, but rather an intelligent system that can make sense of hundreds of tasks across dozens of projects and automatically coordinate them across every person on the team. Motion allows companies to focus on the work they need to do rather than wasting up to 50% of their resources on overhead.Our users give us data on their workload (e.g. projects and tasks) and resources (employee roles, calendars, and schedules). Based on all this information, Motion makes intelligent decisions about how tasks should be executed better than any human project coordinator. Teams that use Motion know what people are working on at any given time, when each task will be completed, and whether any tasks will fall behind schedule. The moment something changes, instead of the coordinator having to figure out all the cascading effects, Motion instantly creates a new optimized plan for the team.Motion is the project management system of the future. We are growing extremely quickly, trusted by thousands of customers, have millions in revenue, near-infinite runway, and an exceptionally talented team. Most of Motions 30 employees work in engineering, and the majority of those in business and operations roles also have technical skills.About The RoleMotion is hiring an experienced software engineer who can make key technical decisions and implement large software projects to help Motion scale the next 2 orders of magnitude.

### Descripción
```
📍 Location: Remote 💼 Type: Full-time 💰 Compensation: Competitive salary + equity + premium benefits What We Stand For Let’s face it: in most companies, Customer Support is broken. Underpaid, under-respected, and treated like a cost center. Customers wait hours—sometimes days—for a real answer, often from someone who can’t actually fix the problem. Bugs linger across quarters. Feedback vanishes into a black hole. Not here. At Files.com , Customer Support is a first-class technical function —a high-caliber team empowered to make our 4,000+ enterprise customers successful. We treat support as a growth engine : a sharp feedback loop into engineering, product, and leadership. That means when customers hit a snag, you’re not just checking boxes—you’re making the product better. Our Support Engineers are embedded in the product lifecycle. They flag patterns, squash bugs, ship fixes, and influence roadmap priorities. And they do it without burning out, battling bureaucracy, or begging for resources. Who We Are We’re Files.com , a profitable, founder-led SaaS company powering secure file transfer and automation for 4,000+ brands you know: Target, Canonical, UPS, GoPro, Marriott , and more. We’re not a chaotic startup. We’re not a bloated big tech org. We’ve built a $35M+ business with just 70 people by hiring smart, clear-thinking communicators who act fast and own their outcomes. Backed by $46.5M from Riverwood Capital , we’re scaling with intention, and this role is core to that strategy. What Makes This Role Different Technical depth and daily challenge: You’ll solve nuanced technical puzzles every week—API integrations, network misconfigurations, edge-case SFTP workflows, and more. If you like variety and real intellectual engagement, you’ll never be bored here. Support with leverage: You’re backed by an engineering team that tackles bugs in days (not quarters) and a leadership team that listens and acts. We don’t stack up “known issues”—we fix them. Career mobility: Support at Files.com isn’t a stepping stone—it’s a launchpad. Our Support Engineers grow into roles in M anagement, Customer Success, Product, Sales, and even Finance . We invest in you and move fast to unlock your next chapter. Tight-knit, high-performance culture: We’ve built a $35M+ revenue business with just 70 people by hiring smart, clear-thinking communicators who act fast and own outcomes. We’re backed by $46.5M from Riverwood Capital and scaling with discipline—not chaos. What You’ll Do Serve as the front line of technical engagement , supporting customers via phone, email, and Zoom. Troubleshoot and resolve complex issues across networking, API usage, remote integrations, identity management, and file automation. Rapidly identify and escalate bugs—working side-by-side with Engineering to get fixes shipped. Synthesize customer feedback into actionable insights for Product and R&D. Communicate with clarity, empathy, and efficiency—internally and externally. Take full ownership of ...
